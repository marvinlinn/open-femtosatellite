## Project Purpose
{: .fs-6 .fw-700}

As described on the home page, the Open Femtosatellite Project serves two primary motivations: **Education** and **Research/Engineering**. The following sections will provide a breakdown of motivations and objectives with this project.

### Education: An Open and Hands-On Tool

{: .note-title }
> A Short Aside: Systems Thinking and Engineering
>
> A foundational skill in engineering, especially as project complexitiy increases, is a systems-forward
> approach to tackling design challenges. Systems engineering and thinking is often undertaught 
> in undergraduate engineering cirricula, and this project aspires to explore hand-on approaches to 
> systems thinking in engineering pedagogy.

> This project will regularly reference/introduce concepts in systems engineering, follwing the 
> "Systems Engineering V Framework" as seem above. For more detailed exporations of systems thinking and
> engineering, I reccomend [MATLAB's Video Series on Systems Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08owzDpgnQr7vo2O-FUQm_fL) as well as the [NASA Systems Engineering Handbook](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nasa_systems_engineering_handbook_0.pdf).
