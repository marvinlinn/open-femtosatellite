## What is a Concept of Operations (ConOps)?
{: .fw-700 }

At a high level, a ConOps is a document considering and describing all stages of nominal and non-nominal operations. This includes human-payload interactions, communication strategies, data architectures, integration/operational scenarios, and more. As a whole, the ConOps should evaluate and analyze all stages of operation for the entire lifecycle of the end product. For more information about ConOps, I reccomend reading Section 4.1.2.1 of the [NASA Expanded Guidance for Systems Engineering](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170007238/downloads/20170007238.pdf) as well as the [IEEE 29148:2011 Concept of Operations (ConOps)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/761853).
