## Overview
{: .fw-700 }

The following website provides an overview for the Open Femtosatellite Project. This project was originally conceptualized by Marvin Lin as an undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley, along with inspiration from [Cornell SSDS Chipsats](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/chip-satellites), [University of California--Santa Barbra's Wafersat from Professor Lubin](https://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/projects/wafer-scale-spacecraft-development), and aspirationally a stepping stone *AND* project parallel to the [Berkeley Low Cost Interplanetary Solar Sail from Professor Pister](https://bsac.berkeley.edu/publications/bliss-interplanetary-exploration-swarms-low-cost-spacecraft).

Marvin was orignally interested in exploring the idea of low-cost and open-source satellite platform to increase access to space, thanks to significant influence form his previous work at [OreSat](https://oresat.org). After some intitial research, he realized there was already a great interest in this field from countless universities. Nevertheless, he hopes this additional parallel thread of exploration can continue pushing forwards femtosatellite class technologies

### Education
{: .fw-700 }

The primary objective of this project is to provide students from varying backgrounds and expereince levels access to a hands-on engineering experience centered around spacecrafts. Within the domian of engineering for space, **systems engineering and thinking** are foundational for a successful spacecraft. Teaching these skills at an early age can help shape the next generation of engineers.

The Open Femtosatellite Project is designed to cater towards all levels and expertise of engineers, providing tools and designs acessible to secondary school students through block-based programming built off of the [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), as well as the option to write bare metal and/or RTOS based code directly for the STM32 microprocessor. 

### Engineering & Research
{: .fw-700 }

One domain of interest as mentioned in all three publications/explorations of femtosatellite class spacecrafts is low mass, low cost space exploration and research. This project intends to be another parallel thread exploring the possibilities of mineaturization in spacecraft research, as well as swarm communication technolgoies, imaging, and custom low-power & radiation optimized SoCs (a future project).
