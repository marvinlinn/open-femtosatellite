Welcome to the Open Femtosatellite Project! The following repository holds source files for designs, as well as the documentation for the project.

## Building and previewing the documentaion site locally

Assuming [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html) are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
